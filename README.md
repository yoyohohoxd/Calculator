My first calculator project. This was difficult for me to get working initially so I decided to rework the entire code and layout. I now have a log that stores the number your currenting working on.

In this project I have learned ot use numbers and strings to produce the desired outcome. I have generally become a lot more familiar with Javascript and overcome some of the fear of diving into it. 


07 Oct: Functionality for a calculator. My first major project.
21 Oct: Finished project. If I'm coming back to it I want to add:
1) keyboard support and remove the 'bug', where if you push two operators in a row instead of it giving you an alert it will simply replace the operator.
2) add more functionality to the log so it will save results and append them underneath continously turning more opaque.
3) replace if() and else if() with switch.
